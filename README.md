This bot, built with the telebot library, performs the following actions:

Start Command: When the user sends the /start command, the bot replies with a greeting and asks the user to send a phone number.

Phone Number Validation: The bot listens for any text message. If the message contains a phone number, it validates the number. The validation checks that the phone number starts with a "+" sign and contains between 10 and 15 digits.

Generate Links: If the phone number is valid, the bot generates clickable links for contacting the user via:

Telegram: https://t.me/<phone_number>
WhatsApp: https://wa.me/<phone_number>
Truecaller: https://www.truecaller.com/search/int/<phone_number_without_plus>
Invalid Phone Numbers: If the phone number is invalid, the bot asks the user to send a correct number in the international format (e.g., +1234567890).

Logging: Every received message is logged in a file (bot_messages.log), with timestamps, user ID, and the message content.

Continuous Operation: The bot runs continuously, waiting for new messages using bot.polling(non_stop=True).

This bot serves to generate and provide communication links for the given phone numbers in Telegram, WhatsApp, and Truecaller.

The bot also logs every interaction in a file called bot_messages.log. Here's what happens with this log:

Logging Setup: The logging is configured to write messages to bot_messages.log in append mode. This means that new messages will be added to the end of the log file without overwriting existing entries.

Log Format: The log entries are formatted with a timestamp and the user's message. For example, each log entry would look like this:

yaml
Копировать код
2025-01-07 12:34:56,789 - От пользователя 1234567890: +1234567890
The timestamp shows when the message was received, followed by the user ID (chat ID) and the message content.

Logging Purpose: This log file helps track all messages sent by users, including their phone numbers. This can be useful for debugging or monitoring bot usage, as it provides a record of every input received by the bot.

So, the log file stores the communication history between the bot and users in a structured way.
